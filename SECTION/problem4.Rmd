\textbf{Learning Outcomes}

The problems are designed to build conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills. The emphasis is on learning to find, evaluate and build confidence.
The specific tasks include: 

    - Identifying the range of discrete and continuous random variables
   
   - Deriving the PMF and CDF of a discrete random variable
   
   - Recognizing properties of CDFs
   
   - Back up and support work with relevant explanations

### Exercises 

1. For each situation, give the range of the random variable $X$. Then state whether the random variable is discrete or continuous.

a. $X$ is the number of employees among 12 recently hired that will still be with the company in another year.
		
b. In a busy 24 hour copy center, minor malfunctions of the copy machine occur randomly. $X$ denotes the time (in hours) until the first minor malfunction occurs.
	 
	 
2. Suppose you toss a fair coin 3 times. The sample space for this experiment is shown below:
$$S = \{ HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, TTT,TTH, THT, THH \}.$$

a. Let $X$ denote the difference between number of heads and number of tails. Write the PMF of $X$ in a tabular format.   

b. Draw the probability histogram of $X$ in R. Comment on the appearance of the distribution such as shape, modality.


3. Which of the following is a valid CDF? (choose one; also point out what's wrong with the ones you didn't choose)

Hint: make a sketch 

a. 
\begin{align*} 
        F(x) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 
                 0 & x < 0\\
                 \frac{1}{4} & 0 \leq x \leq 3 \\
                 \frac{3}{4} & 3 <  x < 5 \\
                 1 & 5 \leq x \end{array} \right. \end{align*}

b.
\begin{align*} 
        F(x) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 
                 0 & x < 0\\
                 \frac{1}{4} & 0 \leq x < 3 \\ 
                 \frac{3}{4} & 3 \leq x < 5 \\ 
                 1 & 5 \leq x \end{array} \right. \end{align*}

c. 
\begin{align*} 
      F(x) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 
                 0 & x < 0\\
                 \frac{3}{4} & 0 \leq x < 3 \\ 
                 \frac{1}{4} & 3 \leq x < 5 \\ 
                 1 & 5 \leq x \end{array} \right. \end{align*}
   

d.
\begin{align*} 
       F(x) &= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 
                 0 & x < 0\\
                 \frac{1}{4} & 0 \leq x < 3 \\ 
                 \frac{3}{4} & 3 \leq x < 5 \\ 
                 \frac{7}{8} & 5 \leq x \end{array}   
                 \right.                      
\end{align*}              

4. Write the PMF for the CDF that you identified as valid in problem 3. Also calculate the following probabilities using the CDF and also verify using the PMF.   

a. $P(X > 2)$

b. $P(0.5 < X < 3.5)$
